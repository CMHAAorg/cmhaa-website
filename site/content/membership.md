    quote_text: At the Alliance, we have found a place where like-minded leaders
      share best practice. Most times in business you don’t share anything
      because you’re competing. But with mental health, we’re all competing
      against a common foe. We are very willing learners and collaborators. We
      want to share what we’re doing and learn from others.
