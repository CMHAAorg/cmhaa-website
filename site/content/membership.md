    youtube_quote_text: The last thing we want as leaders is to have employees
      feeling stressed, depressed or anxious, or suffer an undiagnosed mental
      health condition that’s making their lives miserable. But there’s a
      feeling of helplessness among us all about what to do. There is no magic
      solution to dealing with mental health. But I’m hopeful that initiatives
      like Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia become the ‘secret sauce’
      that help businesses take that next step.

    title: Our origins
    leadtext: In 2011, during an informal conversation, three senior business
      leaders agreed to collaborate and bring together a cohort of business
      leaders from across the City of London to address the increasing levels of
      stress in the workplace and to challenge existing work practices that they
      felt were counterproductive to the quality of client service,
      profitability and health of employees.  Poppy Jaman OBE, the co-founder of
      Mental Health First Aid England came on board as Program Director and is
      now the CMHA’s CEO. With seed funding from their respective organisations,
      the three senior business leaders launched CMHA in the UK with 10
      participating firms in October 2012.

    title: What we do
    content: >-
      CMHAA works hand in hand with members, at a leadership and operational
      level, to facilitate change and embed good mental health practice within
      workplaces in a practical, sustainable and measurable way. We do this by:


      Socialising mental heath into the business. Increasing understanding of mental health, challenging any stigma, and fostering a culture of openness within the workplace.



      Developing skills and mental health literacy. Providing all employees with the appropriate language and confidence to talk about mental health, as well as facilitating training and sharing best practice.



      Sustaining and embedding the change. Helping to ensure that good mental health practice is lead and owned by business leaders and becomes integrated into the business’s strategic priorities. 



      Our strength lies in the unique collaboration of our members, working together to draw upon the vast pool of knowledge and experience from across business, and with guidance from our expert advisors, to find, test and deliver solutions that work for our members.

          Joining AIA in 2018 because of their commitment to the health and
          wellbeing of all Australians, mental health has been one of Ben’s key
          focuses where he is leading the operational planning and execution of
          the associated framework.


          Lived experience has aided Ben to develop a more personalised perspective of the impact mental ill-health has within the workplace setting and within the community more broadly. Being a father, husband and avid watcher of the English Premier League, Ben has his hands full but has found the time to peruse Psychology studies at Monash University.

          for me. That’s providing an open workplace for people to be
          themselves, to be vulnerable, and if they need to share their story,
          they can without being judged.

          the stigma associated with asking for that help. As leaders we have a
          role in that. If leaders open up about mental health, the quicker it

        our_board_quote: As a leader, improving mental health starts with a willingness
          to make yourself vulnerable. If you can accept your own short-comings
          and open some of those up to others, people feel less alone. That’s
          all a lot of people in the world want, to feel less alone.
