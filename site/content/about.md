    title: About us
    image: ""
    content: Why? Because as a community, we know that we can do better, and that
      doing better begins with business leaders prioritising the mental
      wellbeing of all of their employees. We also believe that when businesses
      pool their knowledge and resources, share this openly, and work together
      in a collaborative, non-competitive way, we can achieve better, more
      sustainable mental health outcomes for more people, faster.

    vimeo_quote_text: One of the great outcomes of the Alliance so far is that we’re
      opening up a little more frequently and more easily, and just
      acknowledging the reality of the moment we’re all facing. We have to build
      on that as we look to the future.

    title: Our origins
    leadtext: The Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia is part of a growing
      global movement for better workplace mental health, which began in the UK
      almost a decade ago with the establishment of the City Mental Health
      Alliance UK (CMHA UK).
    content: >-
      A number of Australian business leaders had felt for some time that more
      could be done by corporate Australia to support mental health in the
      workplace, and decided to act on that view. They had heard of the great
      work of CMHA UK led by Poppy Jaman OBE, and were particularly interested
      in the organisation’s business-led, expert-guided approach to addressing
      this growing challenge.


      The group reached out to other business leaders to determine their interest in forming a similar alliance in Australia. Some of the country’s largest employers were immediately drawn to the idea, and in early 2020 the Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia was formally established with seed funding provided by its 15 Founding Members.


      Many of the Alliance’s members are direct competitors, yet on their commitment to workplace mental health, they are as one. They recognise that the mental wellbeing of their employees transcends market dynamics, and that working together collaboratively will give us the best chance of delivering real impact for their people.
