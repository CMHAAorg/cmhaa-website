    image: ""
    content: Why? Because as a community, we know that we can do better, and that
      doing better begins with business leaders prioritising the mental health
      and wellbeing of their people in ways that they experience in the
      workplace every day. We also believe that when businesses pool their
      resources, share openly, and work collaboratively towards a common goal,
      better, more sustainable mental health outcomes will be achieved for more
      people, sooner.

    title: Our origins
    leadtext: The Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia is part of a growing
      global movement for better workplace mental health, which began in the UK
      almost a decade ago with the establishment of the City Mental Health
      Alliance UK (CMHA UK).
    content: >-
      A number of Australian business leaders had felt for some time that more
      could be done by corporate Australia to support mental health in the
      workplace, and decided to act on that view. They had heard of the great
      work of CMHA UK led by Poppy Jaman OBE, and were particularly interested
      in the organisation’s business-led, expert-guided approach to addressing
      this growing challenge.


      The group reached out to other business leaders to determine their interest in forming a similar alliance in Australia. Some of the country’s largest employers were immediately drawn to the idea, and in early 2020 the Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia was formally established with seed funding provided by its 15 founding members and participants.


      Many of the organisations involved in the Alliance are direct competitors, yet on their commitment to workplace mental health, they are as one. They recognise that the mental wellbeing of their employees transcends market dynamics, and that working together collaboratively will give them the best chance of delivering real impact for their people.

          When Melinda isn’t working, you’ll find her enjoying backyard cricket with her family and friends, on the tennis court or doing “the bay” with one of her running friends or gorgeous collie, Watson.
        our_board_quote: By showing our vulnerability as leaders, we teach to our people
          that it’s okay to not be okay. We start to erode the barriers that
          have kept people silent for so long.

          Sarah is the National Managing Partner of KPMG’s Innovation, Solutions
          & Ventures portfolio. This team helps shape the future of KPMG by
          exploring and embedding new forms of growth.

          Sarah’s passion for technology was driven at a young age by her father who worked in signals intelligence for the British Government. Her father’s influence led her to study computing and management before joining Accenture in the UK where she spent 12 years of her career working on large scale business and technology transformation programs across utilities, telco and financial services.



          After arriving in Australia in 2008, Sarah spent a decade in executive leadership roles developing and executing joint business and IT strategies in complex environments. Sarah joined KPMG in 2018 in a return to professional services and chose KPMG for three key reasons: the trusted brand, the smart and very human people, and the ambitious growth and development aspirations.



          Sarah has managed just about every work/life integration challenge: emigrating around the world, maternity leave (twice), working part-time, working flex-time, working full-time in two jobs (one at home and one at the office), juggling kids, work, friends, family. Sarah is an outspoken advocate of women in leadership and women in IT.



          Outside of KPMG, she has a passion for understanding how human beings work physically and mentally with a specific interest in longevity and the science of health and fitness. Sarah is a parent to four children and her passions include weightlifting, skiing, road biking and reading sci-fi and fantasy.
