    title: "Early in Career: Thinking Differently"
    leadtext: Informed by research and modelled on the CMHA UK program, ‘Thriving
      from the Start’ our mission is to understand the concerns and challenges
      young people face as they enter the workforce and commence their careers.
    content: >-
      We will do this by:


      \- Challenging mental health stigma and understanding early in career (EIC) perspectives, concerns and experiences relating to mental health and wellbeing as they enter the workforce. 


      \- Making sure the voice of early in career employees is heard through the formation of an EIC committee with EIC representatives from CMHAA member organisations. 


      \- Offering peer support by building a Thriving from the Start network, run by EIC employees, for EIC employees, offering networking, communications and educational events to early in career employees.


      \- Transforming business and creating best practice on delivering support to young, early in career workers.

      If you are a graduate, intern, apprentice or school leaver or in the first
      eight years of your career and have an interest in learning more about
      mental health in the workplace. 

      The Network is run by a committee of volunteers, also in their early careers, who are committed to building mentally healthy workplaces. It was established, and continues to be part of, the CMHAA’s Early in Careers Programme.
