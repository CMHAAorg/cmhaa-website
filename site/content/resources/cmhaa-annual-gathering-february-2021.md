      Australia’s largest workplace mental health study, **Indicators of a
      Thriving Workplace**, is a longitudinal study which Superfriend has run
      for six years and includes responses from more than 10,000 people.


      Key insights from the 2020 National Survey include:


      * Australia’s national workplace mental health and wellbeing increased, scoring 65 out of 100 – but only 5 per cent of Australian workplaces are classed as thriving, with a score of 80 or above;

      * Three in five Australian workers have experienced a mental health condition, two in five say the workplace has caused or exacerbated the situation;

      * Mental health concerns are the most common reason for lower productivity in 2020;

      * The pandemic resulted in better work/life balance for almost half (48.5%) of the workforce; and

      * Transport, postal and warehousing have the highest proportion of distressed workers (40.3%) followed by public administration and retail.


      Superfriend is now working with PwC to develop an in-house tool based on the Indicators survey that will allow organisations to benchmark themselves as a first step toward developing an evidence-based plan for improvement.


      The **National Stigma Report Card** reveals the challenges facing Australians with complex mental health issues. 


      Key Insights include: 


      * Nearly 80 per cent of respondents report facing workplace discrimination;

      * Seven out of ten have avoided applying for employment or seeking flexible work because of stigma regarding their condition;

      * While workplace awareness of mental health conditions has risen, there is still a dearth of practical support; and

      * Pathways to employment are needed, particularly for young people, to reduce long term disadvantage.


      The **Productivity Commission Mental Health** Inquiry notes that mental health is a key driver of economic participation and productivity in Australia. 


      Key Insights from the 2020 report (based on pre-pandemic data) include**:**


      * In 2018 2.4 million Australians 18 and over experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress;

      * There are strong links between employment and mental health; 

      * 65,000 people attempt suicide each year and in 2019 3,300 people died by suicide;

      * Suicide is the leading cause of death in young people; and

      * The cost to the Australian economy of mental illness and suicide is at least $70 billion pa.


      One of the priority reforms advocated by the Productivity Commission Report was to “equip workplaces to be mentally healthy” which aligns directly with the intent of the CHMAA.
    leadtext: A series of reports has clearly documented the scale of the mental
      health challenge facing Australia, and in particular the workplace issues
      that organisations must address.

Every employer in Australia must adhere to the Work Health and Safety Act and associated regulations which encompass mental health issues; this is not discretionary, rather a legislated requirement.

The Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia (CMHAA) was formed by some of the nation’s leading employers in 2020 to support mental health in the workplace. With a combined employment base of 400,000+ people the Alliance shares information and insights and is working toward crafting evidence based best practices that foster mentally healthy workplaces.

In February 2021 Alliance members came together to discuss progress to date and to shape the agenda for the coming year.

Alliance members were presented with the results of several important reports released during the last year (key points detailed below) while Commonwealth Bank shared its approach to promoting the mental health and wellbeing of its people.


Key themes explored during the day included:

* The critical role of data as an evidence base for developing processes and practices, and also to shape metrics for measuring progress;
* The need to boost the mental health literacy of employees, managers, and particularly hiring teams in order to structure jobs so that they are stimulating without being onerous; and 
* The journey that leaders are undertaking to helm mentally healthy workplaces in organisations stretching from large geographically distributed enterprises to sole traders which exist within broader supply chains.

Delegates also determined the action agenda for 2021 – details below. 

Australian employers wishing to join the Alliance are encouraged to contact CHMAA directly to get involved in this important initiative.
