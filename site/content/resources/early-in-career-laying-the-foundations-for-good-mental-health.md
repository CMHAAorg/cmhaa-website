CMHAA officially launched it's 'Thriving from the Start' Early in Career Network and Program in December 2021.  To help shape our direction we conducted focus group discussions with Early in Career employees across a number of our member organisations to enable us to better understand their lived experiences and gain insights on their perspectives of mental health in the workplace. 

We were privileged to hear from an amazing group of young employees and are pleased to share their views in our first research report.
