description: "I entered the legal industry as a summer clerk with MinterEllison
  in 2016. At the time, I was still active with my other career as a
  professional adventurer. As an adventurer, I developed a panic disorder which
  caused me to have panic attacks leading up to my expeditions; often many
  months in advance. "

My journey in understanding and managing my anxiety was long and varied and led to my becoming an ambassador for *BeyondBlue* and also sharing my story through speaking engagements, including delivering a TEDx talk in 2016.

When I joined MinterEllison, I was given the opportunity to contribute to the firm's mental health initiatives by sharing my story both internally to our people and externally to our clients. For RUOK? Day, I travelled to all of the Australian MinterEllison offices to explain how I developed the ability to schedule my panic attacks before heading off on dangerous expeditions to Arctic Alaska, how I viewed my anxiety as the main cause of multiple failed expeditions, and how I learned to accept my anxiety and no longer view it as a weakness of mine.

As the legal industry is rife with mental health issues, being at a firm that endeavours to make progress in the mental health space is important to me. Personally, I have been given the opportunity to take extended leave so that I could continue to pursue some of my expeditions, and this has been integral to my own ability to maintain positive mental health in what is a very challenging industry. Moving forward, I see agile ways of working as a key area in driving positive change and I am heartened by the steps MinterEllison have been taking in this regard.
