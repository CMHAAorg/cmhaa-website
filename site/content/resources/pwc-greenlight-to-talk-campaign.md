      ### How we respond


      The campaign Green Light to Talk was launched in May 2016, during Mental Health Awareness Week, with the objective of normalising conversations around mental well-being and mental ill-health.


      * **Green ribbon**: A key result of the Green Light to Talk campaign is that in 2017 the Lord Mayor’s Appeal approached PwC and asked to incorporate the Green Ribbon into the This is Me campaign, complementing This is Me story-telling from Barclays. As a result, this has gone far beyond just a PwC campaign and in Mental Health Awareness Week 2019 over 250,000 people wore a green ribbon across the UK. In addition, increasingly people at PwC are wearing green ribbons all year around and taking them to client sites. PwC has now launched this campaign in other offices around the world including Australia and the US.

### The Challenge

The campaign Green Light to Talk was launched in May 2016, during Mental Health Awareness Week, with the objective of normalising conversations around mental well-being and mental ill-health.
There were three key aspects of the campaign from the beginning:

1. **Wearing a green ribbon**. PwC created ‘Green Light to Talk’ day on the Thursday of Mental Health Awareness Week. On this day people were invited to wear a green ribbon as a visible demonstration that they were happy to have conversations about mental health.
2. **Storytelling**. Beyond the Green Light to Talk day, PwC wanted to sustain the change in culture and encourage conversations around mental health all year round. Every month since May 2016,a PwC employee has told their mental health story, creating a simple and personal video. This is shared as part of the ‘Green Light to Talk series’, right across the fim via its intranet news channel.
