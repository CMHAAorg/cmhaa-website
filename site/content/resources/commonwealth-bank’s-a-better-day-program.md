      To ensure the content developed was relevant and accessible to all, a
      number of channels of engagement also had to be considered, such as
      podcasts, articles, videos, infographics and interactive PDFs. 


      An added challenge within the current context of COVID-19, was that many employees were working remotely at the time of the Program’s launch, requiring much greater focus to be placed on internal communications as a means of promotions since no physical launch event could be held. Channels of promotion included Intranet articles, leader’s notes, a direct email to all employees, Yammer posts, as well incorporating the Program into webinar/Skype sessions delivered to teams on the wellbeing resources available.


      CBA’s current challenge is to ensure employees continue to engage with and utilise the resources of *A Better Day* to drive behavioural change and maximise the benefits of the Program. As a starting point, ongoing promotion and advocacy of the Program will be required.
    title: Time and resources needed
    leadtext: The Program was designed and built in-house over several months. In
      order to develop a truly holistic program, the resources within the
      Program were developed in consultation with a number of leading industry
      experts including psychologists, sleep specialists, exercise
      physiologists, and dieticians.

      **Outcomes**


      *A Better Day* launched in June 2020, so whilst the outcomes of this Program have yet to be determined, the intended benefits include:


      * Increased awareness of the importance of staying mentally fit by creating a sustainable, self-paced platform that allows employees the opportunity to invest in their own wellbeing as and when they need it.

      * A reduction in employee’s overall perceived levels of stress and an improvement in levels of wellbeing which can be captured through the *A Better Day* Program Questionnaire.

      * Employee advocacy and endorsement of the Program through direct feedback and engagement in internal networking platforms such as Yammer.

      * Increased levels of employee engagement and productivity demonstrated through annual engagement surveys.

      * A reduction in Lost Time Injury Rates related to work-related psychological injury; and reduced unplanned absences and staff turnover.

**Our challenge**

Critical to the success of *A Better Day*, is the ability to provide a tailored solution to close to 50,000 employees based at over 1,400 locations across the globe. Recognising that there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to managing wellbeing, to personalise an employee’s *A Better Day* journey, a short questionnaire must be completed first. Then, drawing on the knowledge from experts in a number of different fields, tailored solutions are provided to the employee via a personalised dashboard based on their responses to the questionnaire. Even for those feeling great, *A Better Day* can enhance the skills, awareness and understanding to stay that way.

Another key challenge is ensuring *A Better Day* provides holistic solutions in addressing mental health and wellbeing. From mindfulness practices, dietary guidance, best practice sleep techniques, to how to cope with change; the Program is designed to address the many interdependent parts that effect and contribute to an individual’s mental wellbeing.

*A Better Day* is also accessible 24/7 to CBA employees to ensure key resources can be accessed anytime, anywhere. The Program questionnaire can also be retaken at any point to reflect the employee’s most current circumstances.
