      *As we face a global mental health crisis, every business has to be
      radical and relentless in its expectation of itself to support the mental
      health of its people. It is not just the right thing to do, it is key to
      building a sustainable business. A business where your people can stay
      well and thrive, even in challenging times. One where people want to stay
      and where people want to join. A business which is a good corporate
      citizen, an increasingly important measure for all stakeholders, including
      investors.*


      *Over recent years we have seen a growing number of multinationals commit, or take steps to, support the mental health of their people across the world. The CMHA is sharing this business led, expert guided Global Framework to ensure that all multi-national organisations have the direction and guidance they need continue this journey. Now is the time to act.*

      The Framework incorporates years of workplace mental health experience from across the CMHA membership of 54 large businesses, including Deloitte, Oliver Wyman, HSBC and Linklaters. It has also been informed by mental health experts, academic research and workplace reports. 


      The Global Thriving At Work Framework is designed to be used by organisations that are seeking to develop global mental health and wellbeing approaches, or it can also be used as a baseline for the development of programmes of work in countries and/or cities that are just starting their journey. It does not replace the [existing UK](https://citymha.org.uk/Resources/Thriving-at-Work-UK-Guide) or [HK Thriving At Work Guides](https://www.cmhahk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20191114-CMHA-HK-TAW-Guide-Nov2019.pdf), which are more detailed and have been tailored to those particular regions, but it does align with them. The framework includes a simple means of self-assessment that will allow businesses to measure their progress against the three pillars, to help them further embed change.


      Jaman said, “The development of this Framework shows the strength of the CMHA global community as its pool its knowledge, data and experience to create a unique guide.”

      standards for organisations to adopt in developing their wellbeing
      strategies, based on existing good practice in business. It was developed
      by CMHA UK and launched in 2018 in response to the recommendations in the
      2017 Stevenson/Farmer's ‘Thriving at Work Review of Mental Health and
      Employers’. "

The Framework lays out three Pillars, which are strategic aims, that global organisations should work towards achieving in order to build a mentally healthy organisation. These three pillars provide businesses with a template for building a sustainable global mental health strategy, and are underpinned by evidence-based recommendations, including practical suggestions based on real business experience. These relate to areas such as challenging mental health stigma, people management and ways of working, and can be applied to different organisations, cultures, and industries. 

The three Pillars are:
