  mental health at the heart of the business agenda. As a part of the CMHA
  group, we share this vision. We want to see businesses, globally, prioritise

      The framework has been developed using evidence and learning from across
      the global CMHA membership community on what works in practice, and has
      been informed by academic research, workplace reports and other resources
      from across the globe.


      It does not replace existing local [Thriving at Work Guides](https://citymha.org.uk/Resources/Thriving-at-Work-UK-Guide) but sits above these as an overarching framework.

    article_description: "The CMHA Thriving at Work Guide is a framework of
      standards for organisations to adopt in developing their wellbeing
      strategies, based on existing good practice in business. It was developed
      by CMHA UK and launched in 2018 in response to the recommendations in the
      2017 Stevenson/Farmer's ‘Thriving at Work Review of Mental Health and
      Employers’. "

To achieve this, CMHA has created the Global Thriving at Work Framework, the first resource of its kind to help guide global organisations in developing their approaches to workplace mental health.

The framework uses an integrated approach that covers a wide range of factors which impact mental health and wellbeing in the workplace. It is intended for organisations that are either seeking to develop global mental health and wellbeing approaches or as a baseline for the development of programs of work in countries and/or cities that are starting their journey.
