      **Third party personal information you provide:** If you provide us personal information about other people, for example your colleagues or employees, you are responsible for ensuring those individuals are aware of this Privacy Policy and you have their consent to do so.

      We implement and maintain processes and security measures to protect personal information which we hold from misuse, interference or loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.


      We will also take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information once we no longer require it for the purposes for which it was collected or for any secondary purpose permitted under Australian privacy laws.


      ### 7. Who we disclose your personal information to, and why?


      We may transfer or disclose your personal information to our related charitable entities and external service providers so that they may perform services for us or on our behalf.
