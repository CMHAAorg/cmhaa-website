        feat_member_description: I really appreciated how important mental health was
          after dealing with the final stages of my father’s cancer (he passed
          away three years ago). We had to manage his palliative care at home.
          At the same time, Mum was developing dementia, and I started a new
          role at Microsoft.

          mental health can cause. One story about a colleague, in particular,
          fuels my drive to make a difference.

        feat_member_description: Since I was a small child, the issue of mental health
          has been around my life. I grew up in a rural area and I heard many
          stories of young men struggling with stress or relationship breakups
          who shot themselves. I had an uncle who died by suicide. When I was
          young, it almost seemed normalised.
